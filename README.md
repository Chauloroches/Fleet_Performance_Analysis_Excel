# Objective:
Analyze fleet performance data to identify cost optimization opportunities, assess vehicle utilization, and improve overall efficiency in the transportation industry.
## Dataset:
Vehicle_ID: Unique identifier for each vehicle.
Date: Date of the trip.
Distance_Travelled (km): Total kilometers covered during a trip.
Fuel_Consumed (L): Fuel consumption during the trip.
Maintenance_Cost (USD): Cost of maintenance for the vehicle.
Trip_Count: Number of trips completed on that day.
Driver_Name: Name of the driver.
Region: Region of operation (North, South, East, West).
Revenue (USD): Revenue generated from the trips.
Trip_Duration (hours): Total duration of the trips.
## Tasks and Steps:
## Data Cleaning
Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values.
Ensure the date column is in a uniform format.
Verify that numeric fields have valid values (e.g., no negative distances or revenues).
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform analysis to uncover trends and insights, such as:

Average fuel efficiency (Distance_Travelled / Fuel_Consumed).
Total revenue by region.
Maintenance cost trends over time.
Identify underperforming vehicles (low revenue, high fuel consumption).
## Data Visualization
Create charts to display key metrics and trends:
Bar chart: Revenue by region.
Line chart: Maintenance cost over time.
Pie chart: Share of revenue by vehicle.
Scatter plot: Fuel efficiency vs. distance traveled.
